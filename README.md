# CSS Animating and Transforming

I had a lot of fun with this guide, who would have thought that css could be this fun?? I generally try to stay away from css, it's not my strong suit and I have never enjoyed writing css but animations are really fun and I think I will be writing more CSS from now!

I followed some tutorials and looked at some codepens, most of the animations are from other sources, altought I wrote the "box dance" animation all by myself and I'm really proud of it! Yay me :D
